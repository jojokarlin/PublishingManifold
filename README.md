## Workshop Plan

The goal of this two-hour workshop is to give attendees an opportunity to explore Manifold and begin getting comfortable managing content on a Manifold project.

In particular, we'll cover the following:

- What is Manifold?
- What can you publish?
- Publishing EPUBs 
- Publishing Google Docs
- Questions

Everyone will create a project on the [CUNY Manifold Instance](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org). I'll walk everyone through basic project setup steps, and then cut you loose to setup your own projects.

### What is Manifold?
In this portion, we review the origins of Manifold from the first Debates in Digital Humanities site built by [Cast Iron Coding](www.castironcoding.com) for the collection edited by [Matt Gold]() published by [Doug Armato]() and [The University of Minnesota Pres](). After discussing the [Andrew R. Mellon Foundation]()'s origin funding for the non-pdf solution for the scholarly monograph, we summarize the development that led Manifold to its broader purposes for Open Access and Open Educational Resource publishing.

After orienting the participants within the history of the project, we take them to [CUNY's Manifold instance](cuny.manifoldapp.org) to demonstrate the [project layout](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-19b8ffcb-9e36-4979-83f2-d41520e8dd05/section/6b3e8941-3c60-4a65-a259-7713d3ff2878), reading experience, and [annotation functionality](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-cfeb52cc-ce23-4eb5-b039-7baf200760ed/section/099f95ae-a371-483d-a6e9-c44d7e8f5418). The demo shows how users can navigate texts, [add and embed resources](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-0db854db-81d0-4a6c-aeb6-3d74d67a19bf/section/6e7e3261-7475-4ad4-8b5c-113cbe6652c2) and create resource collections, and annotate, share or cite the project they are reading.

### What can you publish?
In this segment, we talk about the types of projects you might create and the formats of text and resources that Manifold can ingest. 

#### Teaching Models
Manifold supports many uses, including the publication of vibrant, interactive on-line texts for teachers. For our workshops, we introduce participants to a few examples of work CUNY faculty and students have published. These examples are helpful for understanding the different options available and what sort of preparation the materials require for publication. In all cases, the authors decide their own license, though we encourage them to consider using a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/). For more about OER licenses, check out the [City College English Department OER Guide](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/city-college-english-department-oer-guide) by Julia Brown, Yolande Brener, and Janelle Poe, and GC Librarian Jill Cirasella's ["Transformed, I'm Sure: A (Polite) Guide to Fair Use in DH"](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_pubs/509/).

##### Rich Course Texts

Instructors often leverage Manifold's capacity to store multimedia resources that complement the text. For example, Julie von Peteghem (Hunter) used Manifold to publish her selection of [Petrarch's Canzoniere](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/canzoniere) and annotate each text with [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) openly licensed audio recordings of native Italian speakers reading the poems.

   *For this project, Julie von Peteghem learned **markdown** and created a manifest for ingestion*

Justin Rogers-Cooper (LaGuardia) created an edition of [Hubert Harrison's The Negro and the Nation](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/hubert-harrison-the-negro-and-the-nation) for his American Studies seminar at the Graduate Center. Students contributed resources and annotations over the course of the semester, as he describes on the project homepage.

*This project was created in **markdown** and ingested with a manifest*

##### CUNY Student Editions
Conceived of and helmed by Paul Hebert, [CUNY Student Editions](https://github.com/CUNY-Student-Editions) are edited versions of public domain texts that ensure students have access to the same, high quality edition.

*CUNY Student Editions are built as **EPUBs** and follow the stylesheet provided on the project github repository.*

a for Collaborative Annotation
 - The Scarlet Letter and Migos Studies

##### Publishing Student Work
Several groups and individuals have used Manifold to publish collections of student work.

MALS student Jing Zhao used Manifold to publish his capstone ["Spatial Distribution of Chinese Language Education and Historical Development of Chinese Language Pedagogy in Higher Education in the United States."](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/spatial-distribution-of-chinese-language-education-and-historical-development-of-chinese-language-pedagogy-in-higher-education-in-the-united-states)

*Each chapter of this project was written in a separate **Google doc** and ingested with a manifest.*

Brooklyn College literature instructor Marianne Mador√© used Manifold to publish a collection of reflections her students wrote in ["Gender & Society" and us in the classroom](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/gender-and-society) 

*Each essay was written in **Microsoft Word** and ingested as individual texts.*

The Futures Initiative used Manifold to publish [Structuring Equality: A Handbook for Student-Centered Learning and Teaching Practices](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/structuring-equality), the culmination of [Cathy Davidson](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/Core-Bios/Cathy-N-Davidson)'s seminar at the Graduate Center.

*Each chapter of this project was written in a separate **Google doc** and ingested with a manifest.*

#### What types of files can you publish?
 - Google Docs (using pulblic share url)
 - Word Docs (.docx)
 - Markdown
 - HTML/CSS
 - EPUB, a common format for ebooks. Check out [Standard Ebooks](standardebooks.org) for high quality EPUBS of public domain texts.
 - manifest ingestion of multiple file types (see [dummy manifest](https://github.com/jojokarlin/PublishingManifold/blob/master/manifest.yml) in this repository)

#### What kind of resources can you add to resource library and annotation?
 - Images. (GIF, JPEG, JPG, PNG) will display within the resource library
- Video. (MP4, WEBM, FLV, MOV, AVI, YouTube, Vimeo) will display within the resource library
- Audio. (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, OGA) will display within the resource library
- File. (Unrestricted) resource library will present details and offer download
- Link. (URL) resource library will present resource details and offer live link
- PDF. resource library will present resource details and offer download *At this point there is **no** PDF viewer in Manifold, if you are interested in supporting this functionality, we invite you to [request a feature](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold/issues/new?template=features.md).
- Document. (DOC, DOCX, TXT, ODT) resource library will present resource details and offer download
- Spreadsheet. (XLS, XLSX, ODS) resource library will present resource details and offer download
- Presentation. (PPT, PPTX, ODP) resource library will present resource details and offer download
- Interactive. (Embed URL) resource library will present resource details and display interactive media within the frame.

### Publishing EPUBS
This section is an abbreviated version of the workshop we ran at [ACH 2019 in Pittsburgh](https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/ach-workshop). Once we make sure everyone has a reader account on Manifold (signing up on the cuny.manifoldapp.org home page) and has requested permission to create projects (signing up via the permissions form linked on cuny.manifoldapp.org), we walk them through setting up a project and uploading and ingesting a free and openly licensed EPUB.

We then walk them through the basics of configuring elements of the layout tab (to set up a "call to action" start reading button for their new draft project).

### Publishing Multiple Google Docs
After describing how a url of a Google doc may be uploaded singly via the text tab in the backend, we talk a bit about how one might ingest a full text comprised on several chapters. For the purposes of quicker online instruction, we demonstrate how using a manifest with multiple google doc links may be used to ingest a full text comprised of multiple collaboratively written documents.

### Questions
Questions inevitably come up when people are first using a new platform. Often, the answers to these questions are in the [Manifold documentation](https://manifoldapp.org/docs/), but for people unaccustomed to looking at instructions this way, we offer several [quick guides](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/projects/getting-started-with-manifold) that walk you through some standard tasks. The [Manifold Slack channel](https://manifold-slackin.herokuapp.com/) is an excellent way to reach out to other users and the development team. There are special channels dedicated to accessibility and teaching. CUNY creators may also join the CUNY Academic Commons [CUNY Manifold Users group](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/groups/cuny-manifold-users/).
