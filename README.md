The goal of this two-hour workshop is to give attendees an opportunity to explore Manifold and begin getting comfortable managing content on a Manifold project.

In particular, we'll cover the following tasks:

Creating an account and logging in
Creating a Manifold project
Ingesting texts
Customizing the project page
Creating resource collections and resources

Everyone will create a project on the CUNY Manifold Instance at https://cuny.manifoldapp.org. I'll walk everyone through basic project setup steps, and then cut you loose to setup your own projects.
