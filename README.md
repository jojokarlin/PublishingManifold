## Workshop Plan

The goal of this two-hour workshop is to give attendees an opportunity to explore Manifold and begin getting comfortable managing content on a Manifold project.

In particular, we'll cover the following:

- What is Manifold?
- What can you publish?
- Publishing EPUBs 
- Publishing Google Docs
- Questions

Everyone will create a project on the [CUNY Manifold Instance](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org). I'll walk everyone through basic project setup steps, and then cut you loose to setup your own projects.
