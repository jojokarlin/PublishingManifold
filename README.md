## Workshop Plan

The goal of this two-hour workshop is to give attendees an opportunity to explore Manifold and begin getting comfortable managing content on a Manifold project.

In particular, we'll cover the following:

- What is Manifold?
- What can you publish?
- Publishing EPUBs 
- Publishing Google Docs
- Questions

Everyone will create a project on the [CUNY Manifold Instance](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org). I'll walk everyone through basic project setup steps, and then cut you loose to setup your own projects.

## What is Manifold?
In this portion, we review the origins of Manifold from the first Debates in Digital Humanities site built by [Cast Iron Coding](www.castironcoding.com) for the collection edited by [Matt Gold]() published by [Doug Armato]() and [The University of Minnesota Pres](). After discussing the [Andrew R. Mellon Foundation]()'s origin funding for the non-pdf solution for the scholarly monograph, we summarize the development that led Manifold to its broader purposes for Open Access and Open Educational Resource publishing.

After orienting the participants within the history of the project, we take them to [CUNY's Manifold instance](cuny.manifoldapp.org) to demonstrate the [project layout](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-19b8ffcb-9e36-4979-83f2-d41520e8dd05/section/6b3e8941-3c60-4a65-a259-7713d3ff2878), reading experience, and [annotation functionality](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-cfeb52cc-ce23-4eb5-b039-7baf200760ed/section/099f95ae-a371-483d-a6e9-c44d7e8f5418). The demo shows how users can navigate texts, [add and embed resources](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-0db854db-81d0-4a6c-aeb6-3d74d67a19bf/section/6e7e3261-7475-4ad4-8b5c-113cbe6652c2) and create resource collections, and annotate, share or cite the project they are reading.
